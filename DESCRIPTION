Description: The goal of hider is to simplify secure encryption so the average
    R user can utilize it hasslefree. Most people will avoid encryption because
    to employ it at even a basic level, requires a basic understanding of the
    logic that makes RSA very secure. This package provides two functions that
    are wrappers around functionality from the package 'sodium'. The functions are
    called "hide" and "unhide" and it uses a pair of keys that can be provided, or
    can be generated using a third function called "keychain".
